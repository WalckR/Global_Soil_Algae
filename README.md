# This repository contains the code used for the analyses in the paper "Contribution of soil algae to the global carbon cycle"

Paper reference: Jassey V., Walcker, R., Kardol, P., Geisen, S., Heger, T., Lamentowicz, M., Hamard, S., Lara, E. (2022) Contribution of soil algae to the global carbon cycle. New Phytologist. https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17950.

The dataset can be downloaded here.

# The code is organized as follows:

The folder titled "Soil_algae_Geospatial" contains Python code that can be used in Jupyter lab.

The folder titled "Soil_algae_R" contains R code that can be also used in Jupyter lab.

# Install Earth Engine API and geemap

Install the Earth Engine Python API and geemap. The geemap Python package is built upon the ipyleaflet and folium packages and implements several methods for interacting with Earth Engine data layers, such as Map.addLayer(), Map.setCenter(), and Map.centerObject().
